# Credit Scoring Model

This project develops a **Credit Scoring** model using **Logistic Regression**, a widely used method in predictive analysis and binary classification. The goal of the model is to predict the likelihood of customer default based on financial and demographic variables, helping financial institutions make better-informed credit decisions.

### Importance of Logistic Regression

**Logistic Regression** is crucial in this type of analysis due to its ability to model the probability of an event occurring (in this case, default) based on different factors. This model is preferred for its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency in binary classification problems, especially when understanding the relationship between dependent and independent variables is important.

### Key Metrics

The performance of the model is evaluated using key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. These metrics help to assess how well the model identifies defaulters and non-defaulters, ensuring a balance between minimizing false positives and false negatives.

### Bilingual Support

The original version of this project was written in **Portuguese**, but there is a translated version available in **English**, making the project accessible to a broader audience.

Feel free to explore the notebook and experiment with the data!
